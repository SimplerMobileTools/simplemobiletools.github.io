**Hard forks of SimpleMobileTools on December 2nd, 2023**

These forks are for archival purposes due to purchase by ZipoApps. Reference and discussion can be found here: https://lemmy.world/post/9057823. Any previous maintainers of SimpleMobileTools will be added here as maintainers upon request. If anyone wishes to continue this project, a rebrand and distribution methods will be agreed upon with new maintainers.
